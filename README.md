# -Determine-the-strength-of-nanoparticle-based-Oil-Well-Cements
I am working on to increase the strength of oil well cement by using nano-particles. I am using commercial Zinc Oxide for my Objective and comparing the results with Silicon di-oxide. I am using anhy. Calcium Chloride as an accelerator and PAC-R to reduce the filetration loss.
